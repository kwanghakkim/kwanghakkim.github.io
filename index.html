I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in <b>Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</b> at
<a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego (UCSD)</a>, where I am advised by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Krsti%C4%87">Prof. Miroslav Krstić</a>
and <a href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/mamadou-diagne-0">Prof. Mamadou Diagne</a>.
My research focuses on <b>nonlinear and safety-critical control of nonholonomic systems</b>, with an emphasis on
<b>control Lyapunov and barrier function (CLF/CBF)</b> methods for systems with state constraints, actuation constraints and uncertainty. I work on problems including <b>nonholonomic vehicle parking</b>,
<b>robust safety filters for moving obstacles</b>, and
<b>high-relative-degree safety constraints</b>, with applications to autonomous ground
vehicles and aircraft-carrier deck operations. Recently, my work has developed <em>analytic feedback designs</em> for nonholonomic robots that are <em>safe</em>, <em>inverse-optimal</em>, <em>adaptive</em>, and guarantee
convergence in <em>fixed or prescribed time</em>.

<br><br>

I hold an <b>M.S.</b> in Mechanical Engineering from UC San Diego and a <b>B.S.</b> in
Aerospace Engineering from <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>.
Prior to my doctoral studies, I conducted undergraduate research in autonomous systems under
<a href="https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu">Prof. Ufuk Topcu</a>
and in experimental mechanics at Seoul National University.

<br><br>

Outside of research, I enjoy golfing and exploring new video games. My favorite course in San Diego is the <em>Steel Canyon Golf Club</em>, and my game of the year for 2025 is <em>Clair Obscure: Expedition 33</em>!
